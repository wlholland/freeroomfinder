# FreeRoomFinder – BYU

Find unoccupied classrooms at BYU for any day and time window. Great for grabbing a quiet study space or an open room for a group meeting.

**Live at:** [freeroomfinder-production.up.railway.app](https://freeroomfinder-production.up.railway.app)

---

## What it does

1. You pick a **building**, a **day**, and a **time range** (or use the "Right Now" quick-select)
2. The app searches BYU's class schedule and returns every room that has free time during that window
3. Rooms are sorted: fully free ones first, then partially free ones with their available sub-windows shown
4. Click any room number to open its full schedule on BYU's scheduling site

## Running locally

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+

```powershell
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment (first time only)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Start the dev server
.venv\Scripts\uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

`--reload` watches for Python file changes and restarts automatically. Frontend changes (HTML/CSS/JS) take effect on browser refresh.

> **Note:** Port 8000 may be blocked on some Windows machines. Use `--port 8080` or any other free port.

## How the cache works

BYU's scheduling site doesn't expose a public API, so room schedules are scraped on demand and stored in SQLite.

- **First search of a building:** triggers a full crawl (rooms 1–499 in both alpha and numeric formats). Takes 30–90 seconds. A live progress bar is shown.
- **Subsequent searches:** instant — data is served from the local DB cache.
- **Cache is shared:** if one user crawls a building, everyone benefits immediately.

The `cached` / `not cached` badge next to each building name shows its status at a glance.

## Automatic semester management

No manual maintenance is required between semesters. The app is fully self-managing:

### Term detection

On startup, the app scrapes [academiccalendar.byu.edu](https://academiccalendar.byu.edu) to get the exact start date of every upcoming semester (current year + 2 years ahead). This data is stored in the DB and refreshed weekly. The current BYU term code (`YYYYT`) is computed from today's date against that schedule.

If BYU's calendar site is unreachable, the app falls back to an algorithmic estimate based on approximate semester windows.

### Automatic cache wipe

The day before each new semester starts, the app clears all cached room and schedule data so users always search the current semester's schedule. A background task checks once per day — no redeploy or manual action needed.

### Term code format

BYU uses `YYYYT` where `T` is:

| Suffix | Semester | Approx. dates |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | Winter | Jan – Apr |
| `3` | Spring | Apr – Jun |
| `4` | Summer | Jun – Aug |
| `5` | Fall | Sep – Dec |

Example: `20261` = Winter 2026.

## Environment variables (Railway)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Auto-set by Railway | Port the server listens on |
| `DB_PATH` | Yes | Path to SQLite file on the mounted volume (e.g. `/data/freeroomfinder.db`) |
| `YEAR_TERM` | No | Override the auto-detected term code (useful for local testing only) |
| `DISCOVERY_SEMAPHORE` | No | Max concurrent room-scrape requests (default: `15`) |
| `CRAWL_DELAY` | No | Seconds between requests during discovery (default: `0.5`) |

> `YEAR_TERM` does not need to be set in production. The app detects the current term automatically.

---

## Deployment (Railway)

The app is configured for Railway via `railway.toml`. It uses:
- A **GitHub-connected service** for the app code (auto-deploys on push to `main`)
- A **volume** mounted at the `DB_PATH` location for SQLite persistence

To deploy changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

Railway picks up the push and redeploys automatically.
